## Epics
1. Develop Project Plan and Timeline: This should outline the project's timeline, milestones, and deliverables, as well as the resources required to complete the project.

2. Define Functional Requirements: This should describe the functionality of the web application, including the user interface, data handling, and any third-party integrations.

3. Define Technical Requirements: This should detail the technical aspects of the web application, such as the programming language, framework, and infrastructure requirements.

4. Design User Interface and user Experience: These should provide visual representations of the web application's user interface and design.

5. Develop a Testing Plan: This should outline the testing procedures that will be used to ensure that the web application functions correctly and meets the project's requirements.

6. Develop a Deployment Plan: This should detail the steps required to deploy the web application to a production environment.

7. Define Ongoing Maintenance and Support Requirements: This should outline the ongoing maintenance and support requirements for the web application once it is deployed.

8. Develop a Budget and Resource Plan: This should detail the project's budget and resource requirements, including any staff or third-party costs.

9. Conduct a Risk Assessment: This should identify potential risks to the project and detail strategies for mitigating those risks.

## Test Plan
How will these be tested?

1. Develop a Project Plan and Timeline-Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD): Validate that the project plan and timeline meet the requirements specified by stakeholders.
User Interface (UI) Testing: Validate that the project plan and timeline can be easily understood and used by stakeholders.

2. Define Functional Requirements-Integration Testing: Validate that the web application's functionality works as expected with other systems and APIs.
User Interface (UI) Testing: Validate that the user interface and user experience are intuitive, easy to use, and meet stakeholder expectations.

3. Define Technical Requirements-Load Testing: Validate that the infrastructure can handle the expected number of users and traffic.
Performance Testing: Validate that the web application's performance meets the requirements specified by stakeholders.

4. Design User Interface and User Experience-Usability Testing: Validate that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use for the end-users.
Accessibility Testing: Validate that the user interface can be used by people with disabilities.

5. Develop a Testing Plan
   1. Unit Testing: Validate that the code works as expected at a low level.
   2. Integration Testing: Validate that the web application's functionality works as expected with other systems and APIs.

6. Develop a Deployment Plan
   1. Smoke Testing: Validate that the web application can be deployed successfully. 
   2. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD): Validate that the deployment plan meets the requirements specified by stakeholders.

7. Define Ongoing Maintenance and Support Requirements
   1. User Acceptance Test (UAT): Confirm that the ongoing maintenance and support requirements meet the needs and expectations of the end-users. 
   2. Regression Testing: Validate that the web application's functionality has not been impacted by changes made during maintenance.

8. Develop a Budget and Resource Plan
   1. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Validate that the budget and resource plan is economically viable.
   2. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD): Validate that the budget and resource plan meets the requirements specified by stakeholders.

9. Conduct a Risk Assessment
   1. Risk-Based Testing: Validate that the risk mitigation strategies are effective.
   2. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD): Validate that the risk assessment meets the requirements specified by stakeholders.
